        <h3 class="toggle-header">10 CAT FACTS  <a href="fact.html">("click me")</a><span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h3>
        <ol class="benefit-list">       
            <li><strong>Meowing for Humans:</strong> Adult cats primarily meow to communicate with humans, not other cats. Felines typically communicate with each other through scent, body language, and facial expressions</li>
            <li><strong>Vast Vocal Range:</strong> While dogs typically have about 10 different vocal sounds, cats can make over 100 different sounds, including various meows, purrs, chirps, and growls.</li>
            <li><strong>Masters of Sleep:</strong> Cats are the sleepiest of all mammals, spending an average of 15 hours a day sleeping, which accounts for roughly 70% of their entire lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Nose Prints:</strong> A cat's nose print is as unique as a human fingerprint, with no two patterns being exactly alike</li>
            <li><strong>Exceptional Hearing:</strong> Cats have an impressive 32 muscles in each ear, allowing them to rotate their ears 180 degrees to pinpoint the exact source of a sound. Humans only have six ear muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>"Purr" Healing:</strong> While often a sign of contentment, cats also purr when stressed or injured. The frequency of a cat's purr (between 25 and 150 Hz) is believed to promote bone and tissue healing.</li>
            <li><strong>Jumping Abilities:</strong> Cats are incredible jumpers and can leap up to six times their own body length or height.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Sweet Taste:</strong> Cats cannot taste sweetness. Their ancestors' diet as obligate carnivores means they have far fewer taste buds than humans (around 473 compared to our 9,000)</li>
            <li> <strong>Sweat Through Paws:</strong> Unlike humans, cats don't sweat all over their bodies; they primarily sweat through their paw pads to regulate their temperature</li>
            <li><strong>Record Lifespan:</strong> The oldest cat ever recorded was named Creme Puff, who lived to be an astonishing 38 years and 3 days old</li>
